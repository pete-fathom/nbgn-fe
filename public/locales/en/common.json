    "description": "To buy NBGN, you need EURe. However, EURe has limited liquidity on Arbitrum DEXes, making USDC<>EURe swaps expensive. We recommend using Monerium (monerium.app) directly: After KYC/AML verification (up to 24 hours), Monerium allows you to buy and sell EURe for real euros at 0% fee via bank transfer. Monerium is a trusted, regulated service maintaining a hard 1:1 EUR/EURe peg. Note: We are not affiliated with Monerium - this recommendation is based on our own research. This is not financial advice.",
